#+title: Minimal Intercal C Language Specification
#+author: Qifan Wang

This is a draft
* Permitted Tokens

** Currently supported

Note that the tokenizer assumes the host Common Lisp has
been properly setup that the stream converts =\n= or =\r\n=
to a dedicated =#\Newline= character according to platform's
convention.

- All keywords from ISO C99
- C99 decimal and octal integers
- C99 identifiers
- One character C99 punctuactor
- =/* */= and =//= comment

** Planned but not implemented

At current stage, these can result in unexpected error
in lexing.

- Strings and character literals
- Token =...=

TBD
