Work in Progress C compiler

Copyright (c) Qifan Wang 2024

To run this project, you will need a working Common Lisp
compiler. Clozure CL or Steel Bank Common Lisp is recommended.

You will also need to setup Quicklisp from https://www.quicklisp.org/beta/
so the dependency libraries can be downloaded.
